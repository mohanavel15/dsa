## How to Contribute

### Adding a New Solution

1. **Choose the Right Category**: Place your solution in the appropriate folder (Arrays, Strings, Trees, etc.)

2. **Follow the Template**: Each solution should include:
   ```python
   """
   Problem Name
   
   Problem description here.
   
   Example:
       Input: ...
       Output: ...
       Explanation: ...
   
   Time Complexity: O(...)
   Space Complexity: O(...)
   """
   
   def solution_function():
       # Implementation
       pass
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       # Test cases
       pass
   ```

3. **Include Test Cases**: Add test cases in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block

4. **Document Complexity**: Always include time and space complexity analysis

5. **Write Clear Code**: 
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow Python PEP 8 style guide

### Solution Requirements

- **Problem Description**: Clear explanation of the problem
- **Examples**: At least one example with input/output
- **Implementation**: Working solution with proper logic
- **Test Cases**: Multiple test cases covering edge cases
- **Complexity Analysis**: Big O notation for time and space
- **Comments**: Helpful comments explaining the approach

### Code Style

- Use Python 3
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and simple
- Add docstrings for functions

### Testing Your Solution

Before submitting:
1. Test with provided test cases
2. Test edge cases (empty input, single element, large input)
3. Verify complexity analysis is correct
4. Ensure code runs without errors

### Pull Request Process
