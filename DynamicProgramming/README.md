# Dynamic Programming Problems

Problems solved using dynamic programming approach.

## Problems

1. **Fibonacci Numbers** (`fibonacci.py`)
   - Calculate Fibonacci numbers efficiently
   - Multiple approaches: recursive, DP, iterative

2. **Climbing Stairs** (`climbing_stairs.py`)
   - Count ways to climb stairs
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

## Key Concepts

- Memoization
- Tabulation
- Overlapping subproblems
- Optimal substructure
- Space optimization
