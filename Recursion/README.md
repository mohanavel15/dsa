# Recursion Problems

Problems solved using recursive approach.

## Problems

1. **Factorial** (`factorial.py`)
   - Calculate factorial recursively and iteratively
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(n) for recursive

## Key Concepts

- Base case and recursive case
- Call stack
- Tail recursion
- Recursion vs iteration
- Stack overflow considerations
